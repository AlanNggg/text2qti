# Change Log

## v0.2.0 (2020-??-??)

* Added support for essay questions.
* Added support for numerical questions.
* Added support for question groups.  A subset of the questions in a group is
  chosen at random when a quiz is taken.
* Added support for executable code blocks.  These can be used to generate
  questions automatically.  This feature requires the command-line flag
  `--exec-code-blocks` or setting `exec_code_blocks = true` in the config
  file.
* Fixed a bug that prevented source file names from appearing in error
  messages.

## v0.1.0 (2020-04-01)

* Initial release.
